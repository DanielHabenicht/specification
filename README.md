# ENOWARS Specification
This repository bundles the specification for the communication between different parts of the ENOWARS infrastructure.

## ctf.json
The `ctf.json` serves as the central configuration file for the [EnoEngine](https://github.com/enowars/EnoEngine). It contains information about e.g. the round length, the registered teams and the services/checkers being used.

See [ctf.json](ctf_json.md)
